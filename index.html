    <header><p>Hello Jeffery, I'm making you a website that will have all the info you need to start a podcast.
        There is a lot more work to do but I wanted to give you a preview. I'm thinking about doing it in three sections as outlined below
    as well as adding a bunch of links to videos and other usefull resources.</p>
    </header>
    <section class="abc">
        <div><a href="index.html">Setup</a></div>
        <div><a href="pages/page2.html">Production</a></div>
        <div><a href="pages/page3.html">Distribution</a></div>
    </section>
    <footer>Usefull resources</footer>
</body>
