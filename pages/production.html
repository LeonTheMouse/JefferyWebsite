    <p>Once you have everything ready to go you have to actually record the podcast. Given the software that we decide
      to use it should be as easy as simply pressing record to start, and pressing it again to end. If we incorperate
      video we will need a way to sync the audio and video, but that can be done very easily by hand. Furthermore, it's
      important to remember that this isn't a broadway play, and having a confortable environment is more important than
      a professional one. People like to see mistakes, as long as they're funny.

    <p>There is a lot more to the podcast world than Joe Rogan, although his loose, off the cuff style is appealing to
      many. Take a look at some other popular shows like Tim Dillon's, where he mixes whitty sarcasm with topical
      political
      commentar. Or check out Theo Von,
      the mullet wearing Louisiana native that can make just about anything funny. You can do anything, as long as you
      have
      fun making it.
