        <p>The most important thing to remember when setting up your podcast is that it's yours, and it can be whatever you want it to be. There are podcast that chronicle the tales of heros, killers, and everything in between. Some people simply just talk, others have a production team writing a script. The point is, the definition of a podcast is a bit up in the air, it's up to you to add to what it can be.</p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Software:</span><br>There are many options to choose from when it comes to software for recording audio/video for the podcast, but the best one for right now is definatley Imovie. It should already be installed on your computer, but if you can't find it here is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id408981434?mt=12"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">link.</span></a></p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underlline;">Hardware:</span><br>There are even more options to choose from for hardware, but we will keep it simple for now. You can use the computer and headphones that you already own, and the microphone on your phone can recored audio as you have already figured out. If you would like to use a camera its a simple as setting your phone up, but we can always upgrade down the road.</p>
