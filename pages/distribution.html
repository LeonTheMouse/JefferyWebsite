        <p class="Distrubution">This really is the easiest part. The best way to get started is on youtube, because anyone can post with no verifaction of any kind. Later on we can get onto Spotify, which also shouldn't be very hard at all. The hardest part is going to be marketing the podcast and coming up with ways to keep viewers interested. We can set up instagram, twitter, and tiktok accounts if you so please, but I was also thinking I could repurpose this site to be for our listeners eventually. I don't have a ton to put on here I just thought it would be cool to make this website. I hope you've enjoyed so far, and I'd love some more ideas about what to put on here!</p>
